# Overview

This web app is a forum for creators who want feedback on designs for their code. They log in, create projects of varying types (structure charts, pseudocode, DFDs) and allow others to edit or 
comment on their ideas. It's a place for fun and easy collaboration when creating a program. 

# Purpose
I create better design when I am able to get consistent feedback, so I want to provide a virtual safehaven for ideas. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
